        <p>"In my first year at university, I've encountered a mix of experiences. Most teachers have been friendly and approachable, making the learning environment enjoyable. The administration has been supportive, contributing to a positive atmosphere.</p>
        <p>However, like any academic journey, there are challenges. Some subjects feel less relevant to my future career, and I've come across both good and bad teaching. Despite these initial observations, I'm optimistic about the learning opportunities ahead."</p>
